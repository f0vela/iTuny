iTuny
=====
<b>This project has been discontinued</b>

<b>v 0.5</b>

Source Code for iTuny a launchy companion that allows you to control iTunes.
This app was made with AutoIt 3, the installer interface was made with AutoIt GUI.

Was developed under Windows XP, works on Windows 7 but it needs administrator access to be able to access iTunes.
It needs some work to be used cleanly under Windows 7.

---

This AutoIt is free to distribute and modify to make it better.
